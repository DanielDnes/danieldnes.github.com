<h1 id="About Me">About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Daniel I recently started learning how to make a website and this website is my first one. I guess this is a blog. 
  I don't know but the main point of this website is to try new things I learn on here before working on something more professional.
  So hopefull this website will improve as I learn more about web development</p>
<h1 id="Gallery">Gallery</h1>
<p>As I stated previously I am new to coding so I don't know how to make separate pages nor how to have a folder where I can store pictures that can be displayed on here so here is Danny Devito again.  </p>
